# Hangman
Hangman is a popular yet grim puzzle game. Youâ€™ve probably played the game at least once or twice. Now you can actually create this game yourself!
With functions, loops, lists and other variables, this is a great project for Python basics. As a cherry on top, it even includes a random module.
